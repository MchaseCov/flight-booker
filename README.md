# Flight Booker

This project was completed for the [Flight Booker Assignment on The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/flight-bookers) that is centered around ActiveRecord associations & advanced forms that relate to multiple models at once.

### Project Summary

In this project, you’ll get a chance to tackle some more advanced forms. This is the kind of thing you’ll have to work with when handling user orders for anything more complicated than an e-book. In this case, we’ll build the first three steps of a typical checkout process for booking a one-way flight:

A typical airline booking flow:

- Enter desired dates / airports and click “Search”
- Choose from among a list of available flights
- Enter passenger information for all passengers
- Enter billing information
